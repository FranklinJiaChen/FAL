# Fantasy Anime League (FAL)
Retrieving data for Fantasy Anime League in order to predict how well Anime will do on the upcoming season.

note: this repository is not well organized nor well documented as
it was made quickly before FAL start
and during start of a school term.

To-do: organize the repository and increase automation to minimize work between FAL seasons to acquire data.
should also get air date of last prequel

This will hopefully be updated next FAL season
